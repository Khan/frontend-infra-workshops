# 04 - Splitting Up Large Components

Large components often end up re-rendering more stuff than is necessary when something
changes in the component. If a component uses a lot of:
- props
- state
- context usage
- HOCs
- hooks

a change to any of these things will result in the entire component re-rendering.

Splitting up a large component into a parent component and several smaller child
components means that there will be fewer things (state, context usage, etc.) in
the parent component that can trigger a re-render.  It also means that those things
will be spread out across multiple children so when one of them changes only one of
the children will re-render.

Additionally, we can memoize some or all of the new child components if we want to
prevent them from re-rendering in response to props changes.

## Example

Consider `LargeComponent` below. Clicking on either of the buttons will cause
the whole component to re-render.

```tsx
import {useState} from "react";

import {expensiveComputation} from "./expensive-computation";

const LargeComponent = () => {
    const [foo, setFoo] = useState<number>(0);
    const [bar, setBar] = useState<number>(0);

    const renderFoo = () => {
        expensiveComputation();
        return <>
            <h1>foo = {foo}</h1>
            <button onClick={incrementFoo}>increment foo</button>
        </>;
    };

    const renderBar = () => {
        expensiveComputation();
        return <>
            <h1>bar = {bar}</h1>
            <button onClick={incrementBar}>increment bar</button>
        </>;
    };

    return <>
        <h1>LargeComponent</h1>
        {renderFoo()}
        {renderBar()}
    </>
}
```

Extracting components `Foo` and `Bar` allows those components to update and
re-render indepedently of each other.

```tsx
// foo.tsx
import {useState} from "react";
import {expensiveComputation} from "./expensive-computation";

export default function Foo() {
    const [foo, setFoo] = useState<number>(0);

    expensiveComputation();

    return = <>
        <h1>foo = {foo}</h1>
        <button onClick={incrementFoo}>increment foo</button>
    </>;
}

// bar.tsx
import {useState} from "react";
import {expensiveComputation} from "./expensive-computation";

export default function Bar() {
    const [bar, setBar] = useState<number>(0);

    expensiveComputation();

    return = <>
        <h1>bar = {bar}</h1>
        <button onClick={incrementBar}>increment bar</button>
    </>;
}

// parent.tsx
import Foo from "./foo";
import Bar from "./bar";

const ParentComponent = () => {
    return <>
        <h1>ParentComponent</h1>
        <Foo />
        <Bar />
    </Foo>
}
```

## Notes

- If there are still other things left in the `ParentComponent` that could
  trigger a re-render, you may want to memoize some or all of the children components.
- Splitting up components has the added benefit of making the components easier
  to test. You can even mock the child components when testing the parent component.

## Exercise

1. Use the profiler in React dev tools to measure the render performance of the code 
   in the "exercise" folder.
2. Split `LargeComponent` in the exercise/ folder into a `Parent` component and
   multiple child components.
3. Memoize components as necessary to address remaining render performance issues.
4. Use the profiler in React dev tools to measure the render performance again.

## Bonus - Mocking child components

The following pattern can be quite useful when writing jest tests for large components
that render a number of subcomponents.  The subcomponents can be mocked with module
mocks to return simple strings that are easy to find using `@testing-library/react`'s 
`screen.findByText()`.

```ts
import {render, screen} from "@testing-library/react";
import {Parent} from "./parent";

jest.mock("./foo", ({
    __esModule: true,
    default: () => "Foo",
});

describe("Parent", () => {
    it("should render 'Foo'", async() => {
        // Arrange

        // Act
        render(<Parent />);

        // Assert
        const foo = await screen.findByText("Foo");
        expect(foo).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
});
```

If you want to verify that certain props were passed to a component you can use this pattern:

```ts
import {render, screen} from "@testing-library/react";
import {Parent} from "./parent";
import * as Bar from "./bar";

describe("Parent", () => {
    it("should render the child component", () => {
        // Arrange
        const barSpy = jest.spyOn(Bar, "default").mockReturnValue(<div />);

        // Act
        render(<Parent />);

        // Assert
        expect(barSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith({msg: "hello, world!"}, {});
    });
});
```

NOTE: The extra `{}` in the call to `toHaveBeenCalledWith` is necessary.
