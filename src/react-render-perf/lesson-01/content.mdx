Memoization can be used to avoid unnecessary renders. This is most useful when
the component itself is expensive to render (e.g. the <code>MathJax</code> component in
webapp) or it renders a lot of descedent components.

Memoization works by saving the rendered output of the component based on the
props that are being passed in. Often times props will appear to have changed
when their actual values haven't. In JavaScript, two objects with the same
properties are considered different objects. Similarly, two functions with the
same implementation are considered differen objects.

In order for memoization to have the desired benefit, we don't want the
component to rerender if there are only superficial changes to props.

<code>React.memo(Component, arePropsEqual?)</code> by default does a shallow comparison of
props and as such isn't able to determine when a prop that's an object or function
is the same or not. We can pass a custom <code>arePropsEqual</code> function to override
that behavior. To keep things simple we use a third-party library called
<code>react-fast-compare</code> which provides a function that does a deep comparison of
objects.

```ts
import arePropsEqual from "react-fast-compare";

type Props = {
    user: {name: string, id: string},
    onClick: () => void,
}

const ChildComponent = (props: Props) => {
    // ...
}

export default React.memo(ChildComponent, arePropsEqual);
```

There is a bit of a gotcha here when it comes to props that are functions.
<code>react-fast-compare</code> cannot check if two functions are the same. Imagine the
following scenario:

```ts
import ChildComponent from "./child-component";

type Props = {
    user: {name: string, id: string},
};

const ParentComponent = (props: Props) => {
    const result = useQuery(QUERY);

    const handleClick = () => {
        if (result.data) {
            // do something with the data
        }
    };

    return <ChildComponent user={props.user} onClick={handleClick}>
}
```

Each time <code>ParentComponent</code> renders, a new copy of <code>handleClick</code> will be created
even if the <code>result</code> from <code>useQuery</code> isn't ready yet. We only want this function
to treated as a new function when <code>result</code> changes. React provides a hook called
<code>useCallback</code> which does exactly that by memoizing the function.

```ts
import ChildComponent from "./my-component";

type Props = {
    user: {name: string, id: string},
};

const ParentComponent = (props: Props) => {
    const result = useQuery(QUERY);

    const handleClick = React.useCallback(() => {
        if (result.data) {
            // do something with the data
        }
    }, [result]);

    return <ChildComponent user={user} onClick={handleClick}>
}
```

If the <code>ParentComponent</code> is a class-based component, there is no need to memoize
function props that are pre-bound methods. This is because the method never changes
for the component instance. If the prop is an inline function though, e.g.
<code>onClick=\{() => \{ ... \}\}</code> it should be converted to a pre-bound method, see the
example below.

```ts
import ChildComponent from "./my-component";

type Props = {
    user: {name: string, id: string},
};
type State = {
    result?: Result<typeof QUERY>,
}

class ParentComponent extends React.Component<Props, State> {
    componentDidMount() {
        fetch(QUERY).then((result) => {
            this.setState({result});
        });
    }

    // pre-bound method
    handleClick = () => {
        if (this.result?.data) {
            // do something with the data
        }
    }

    render() {
        return <ChildComponent user={user} onClick={handleClick}>
    }
}
```

**WARNING:**
Memoization is not free. It requires memory so you should be picky when deciding
what to memoize.

## Exercise

1. Use the profiler in React dev tools to measure the render performance of the code in the "exercise" folder.
2. Update the code in the "exercise" folder memoize the <code>Child</code> component to avoid rerender this component.
3. Use the profiler in React dev tools to measure the render performance again
