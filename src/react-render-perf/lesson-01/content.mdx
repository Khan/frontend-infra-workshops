<em>This lesson is focused on memoization of function components.  If you need to memoize a 
class-based component you can define the <code>shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState, nextContext)</code>
method in your class, see https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#shouldcomponentupdate for details.</em>

Memoization of components can be used to avoid unnecessary renders by not re-rendering the
component if the props haven't changed. This is most useful when the component itself is 
expensive to render (e.g. the <code>MathJax</code> component in webapp) or it renders a 
lot of descedent components.

Memoization works by saving the rendered output of the component based on the
props that are being passed in. Often times props will appear to have changed
when their actual values haven't. In JavaScript, two objects with the same
properties are considered different objects. Similarly, two functions with the
same implementation are considered differen objects.

<code>React.memo(Component, arePropsEqual?)</code> is used to memoize components.  If
<code>arePropsEqual</code> isn't provided it does a shallow comparison of props and as 
such isn't able to determine when a prop that's an object or function are equal or not. 
In order for memoization to have the maximum benefit we need some way to determine if
objects have the same contents and if callback props haven't changed.

We can pass a custom <code>arePropsEqual</code> function to override
that behavior. To keep things simple we use a third-party library called
<code>react-fast-compare</code> which provides a function that does a deep comparison of
objects.

```ts
import arePropsEqual from "react-fast-compare";

type Props = {
    user: {name: string, id: string},
    onClick: () => void,
}

const ChildComponent = (props: Props) => {
    // ...
}

export default React.memo(ChildComponent, arePropsEqual);
```

There is a bit of a gotcha here when it comes to props that are functions.
<code>react-fast-compare</code> cannot check if two functions are the same. Imagine the
following scenario:

```ts
import ChildComponent from "./child-component";

type Props = {
    user: {name: string, id: string},
};

const ParentComponent = (props: Props) => {
    const result = useQuery(QUERY);

    const handleClick = () => {
        if (result.data) {
            // do something with the data
        }
    };

    return <ChildComponent user={props.user} onClick={handleClick}>
}
```

Each time <code>ParentComponent</code> renders, a new copy of <code>handleClick</code> will be created
even if the <code>result</code> from <code>useQuery</code> isn't ready yet. We only want this function
to treated as a new function when <code>result</code> changes. React provides a hook called
<code>useCallback</code> which does exactly that by memoizing the function.

```ts
import ChildComponent from "./my-component";

type Props = {
    user: {name: string, id: string},
};

const ParentComponent = (props: Props) => {
    const result = useQuery(QUERY);

    const handleClick = React.useCallback(() => {
        if (result.data) {
            // do something with the data
        }
    }, [result]);

    return <ChildComponent user={user} onClick={handleClick}>
}
```

## Parent is a class-based component

If the <code>ParentComponent</code> is a class-based component, functions passed as props
to child components should be pre-bound methods. A pre-bound method never changes for the 
lifetime of component instance. If the prop is an inline function though, e.g.
<code>onClick=\{() => \{ ... \}\}</code> a new version of the function will be created
each time the component is rendered.  Inline functions being passed as props should be
converted to pre-bound methods as shown below.

**BEFORE**
```ts
class ParentComponent extends React.Component<Props, State> {
    componentDidMount() {
        fetch(QUERY).then((result) => {
            this.setState({result});
        });
    }

    render() {
        return <ChildComponent 
            user={user}
            // A new function will be passed to `onClick` each time
            // `ParentComponent` is rendered.
            onClick={() => {
                if (this.result?.data) {
                    // do something with the data
                }
            }}
        />
    }
}
```

**AFTER**
```ts
class ParentComponent extends React.Component<Props, State> {
    componentDidMount() {
        fetch(QUERY).then((result) => {
            this.setState({result});
        });
    }

    // pre-bound method
    handleClick = () => {
        if (this.result?.data) {
            // do something with the data
        }
    }

    render() {
        return <ChildComponent 
            user={user}
            onClick={this.handleClick}
        />
    }
}
```

**WARNING:**
Memoization is not free. It requires memory so you should be picky when deciding
what to memoize.

## Exercise

1. Use the profiler in React dev tools to measure the render performance of the code in the "exercise" folder.
2. Update the code in the "exercise" folder memoize the <code>Child</code> component to avoid rerender this component.
3. Use the profiler in React dev tools to measure the render performance again
