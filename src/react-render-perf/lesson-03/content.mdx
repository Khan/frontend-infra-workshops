If your context contains an event emitter (or other class instance) and it's only
used once in your application, you can simplify things even further by using a
singleton instance of it.

While singletons are often frowned upon, their use in this scenario offers several
benefits over React Context:

- By default Context will often result in unnecessary re-renders while using a
  singleton will not.
- Context is only available in React so if other code needs access to that data
  we need to figure out some way to pipe that data to that code whereas with a
  singleton, that code can just import it.
- Testing components that use React Context require wrapping the component in an
  appropriate provider which isn't that bad on its own but often times you'll need
  to update the value in the Context.  Updates are easier with a singleton.  The
  only thing we need is a way to reset the singleton before each test.

## Example

Using our example from [Lesson 2](/react-render-perf/lesson-02) we can replace the context
by creating an <code>EventEmitter</code> singleton and using it directly in our components.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import EventEmitter from "eventemitter3";

const emitterSingleton = new EventEmitter();

const Foo = () => {
    const [foo, setFoo] = useState<number>(0);
    React.useEffect(() => {
      emitterSingleton.on("foo", setFoo);
      return () => emitterSingleton.off("foo", setFoo);
    });

    return <h1>foo = {foo}</h1>;
};

const Bar = () => {
    const [bar, setBar] = useState<number>(0);
    React.useEffect(() => {
      emitterSingleton.on("bar", setBar);
      return () => emitterSingleton.off("bar", setBar);
    });

    return <h1>bar = {bar}</h1>;
};

const Parent = () => {
    const [foo, setFoo] = useState<number>(0);
    const [bar, setBar] = useState<number>(0);

    const incrementFoo = () => {
        emitterSingleton.emit("foo", foo + 1);
        setFoo(foo + 1);
    };
    const incrementBar = () => {
        emitterSingleton.emit("bar", bar + 1);
        setBar(bar + 1);
    }

    <>
        <FooBarContext.Provider value={value}>
            <Foo/>
            <Bar/>
        </FooBarContext.Provider>
        <button onClick={incrementFoo}>increment foo</button>
        <button onClick={incrementBar}>increment bar</button>
    </>
};
```

## Notes

### Testing
While singletons are sometimes frowned upon because they can make testing more
difficult in some languages, that isn't the case in JavaScript. It's easy to mock
the singleton using <code>jest</code> if follow these guidelines:

- Export the singleton from its own file.  TODO(kevinb): provide an example of how to
  mock the singleton.
- If you have a custom class instead of using <code>EventEmitter</code> be sure to export
  that as well so that you can use it when mocking the singleton.

### State

Using an event emitter means that we're responsible for updating the state. In the 
example above, we've chosen to do that in the <code>Parent</code> component.  We
could've also sub-classed <code>EventEmitter</code> and made it responsible for managing
state. Ideally though, I think we'll probably want to adopt a state management library
like <code>jotai</code>, <code>zustand</code>, or <code>recoil.js</code>.

## Exercise

The code in the exercise/ folder in this lesson is the same as the solution/ folder
for the Lesson 2.

1. Use the profiler in React dev tools to measure the render performance of the
code in the "exercise" folder.
2. Replace the React Context in the code with a singleton.
3. Use the profiler in React dev tools to measure the render performance again.
