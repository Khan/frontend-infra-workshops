React Context is useful for sharing data with its descendent components without
having to perform prop-drilling (passing props down through several layers of
components). When changes are made to the context, this causes the context and all
of its descendents to be re-rendered. If the number of descendents is large, this 
can result in poor rendering performance.

In order to avoid re-rendering all of the descendents we'd like only those
components using the context to re-render.  Ideally, they should only re-render
if the data that they're making use of changes.

In the following example, everytime we update the <code>value</code> in the context, we
re-render both child components of the context even though only one of them
needs to be updated.

```tsx filename="index.tsx"
import * as React from "react";

type FooBar = {
    foo: number;
    bar: number;
};

const FooBarContext = React.createContext<FooBar>({foo: 0, bar: 0});

const Foo = () => {
    const {foo} = React.useContext(FooBarContext);
    return <h1>foo = {foo}</h1>;
};

const Bar = () => {
    const {bar} = React.useContext(FooBarContext);
    return <h1>bar = {bar}</h1>;
};

const Parent = () => {
    const [value, setValue] = React.useState<FooBar>({foo: 0, bar: 0});
    const incrementFoo = () => setValue(fb => {...fb, foo: fb.foo + 1});
    const incrementBar = () => setValue(fb => {...fb, bar: fb.bar + 1});
    <>
        <FooBarContext.Provider value={value}>
            <Foo/>
            <Bar/>
        </FooBarContext.Provider>
        <button onClick={incrementFoo}>increment foo</button>
        <button onClick={incrementBar}>increment bar</button>
    </>
};
```

To avoid this problem we can replace the plain old JavaScript object being
used for the context's <code>value</code> with a event emitter instance. The instance is
only created once and is never replaced so the <code>value</code> never changes which
means that the context will never trigger a re-render.

The child components will register event listeners for changes to only the
data they care about. The parent component will emit the appropriate event when
increment the values for <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import EventEmitter from "eventemitter3";

const FooBarContext = React.createContext<EventEmitter | null>(null);

const Foo = () => {
    const emitter = React.useContext(FooBarContext);
    const [foo, setFoo] = React.useState<number>(0);
    React.useEffect(() => {
        emitter?.on("foo", setFoo);
        return () => emitter?.off("foo", setFoo);
    }, []);

    return <h1>foo = {foo}</h1>;
};

const Bar = () => {
    const emitter = React.useContext(FooBarContext);
    const [bar, setBar] = React.useState<number>(0);
    React.useEffect(() => {
        emitter?.on("bar", setBar);
        return () => emitter?.off("bar", setBar);
    });

    return <h1>bar = {bar}</h1>;
};

const Parent = () => {
    const [foo, setFoo] = React.useState<number>(0);
    const [bar, setBar] = React.useState<number>(0);
    const emitter = React.useMemo(() => new EventEmitter(), []);

    const incrementFoo = () => {
        emitter.emit("foo", foo + 1);
        setFoo(foo + 1);
    };
    const incrementBar = () => {
        emitter.emit("bar", bar + 1);
        setBar(bar + 1);
    }

    <>
        <FooBarContext.Provider value={emitter}>
            <Foo/>
            <Bar/>
        </FooBarContext.Provider>
        <button onClick={incrementFoo}>increment foo</button>
        <button onClick={incrementBar}>increment bar</button>
    </>
};
```

This is necessary but not sufficient to prevent both <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> from
re-rendering when either <code>foo</code> or <code>bar</code> is incremented. That's because
<code>Parent</code> is re-rendering when its state changes. To avoid this issue we also
need to memoize <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> themselves. Thankfully they don't take any
props so this is trivial to do.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import arePropsEqual from "react-fast-compare";

const Foo = React.memo(() => {
    const emitter = React.useContext(FooBarContext);
    const [foo, setFoo] = React.useState<number>(0);
    emitter?.on("foo", setFoo);

    return <h1>foo = {foo}</h1>;
}, arePropsEqual);

const Bar = React.memo(() => {
    const emitter = React.useContext(FooBarContext);
    const [bar, setBar] = React.useState<number>(0);
    emitter?.on("bar", setBar);

    return <h1>bar = {bar}</h1>;
}, arePropsEqual);
```

## Notes

- The example above shows the <code>Parent</code> component creating the event emitter.  This is
  only necessary if <code>Parent</code> was being used in multiple places and we didn't want its
  descendents sharing the same event emitter.  If there's only a single instance of
  <code>Parent</code> the event emitter could be created outside of the component and could be
  used to initialize the context.  This would result in the context value always being
  defined and we wouldn't need to use optional chaining when accessing properties on
  the <code>emitter</code> we get from the context.
- Why not just use <code>redux</code> for prop-drilling?  Unfortunately, it has the same issues
  as the naive use of context shown in the original code above.  That being said, the context +
  event emitter pattern isn't great either because it's a pattern as opposed to a library.  In
  the long term I think we should evaluate possible replaces for <code>redux</code> that don't
  have this preformance issue like <code>jotai</code>, <code>zustand</code>, or <code>recoil.js</code>.
- <code>React.useMemo(callback)</code> and <code>React.memo(Component, arePropsEqual?)</code> are
  both used to memoize things.  The former is used for memoizing computations _within_ a functional
  component while the latter is used for memoizing functional components themselves.

## Exercise

1. Use the profiler in React dev tools to measure the render performance of the
code in the "exercise" folder.
2. Update the code in the "exercise" folder to use an <code>EventEmitter</code> to prevent
the <code>value</code> in the context provider from changing.
3. Memoize only the necessary components to prevent unecessary re-renders.
4. Use the profiler in React dev tools to measure the render performance again.
